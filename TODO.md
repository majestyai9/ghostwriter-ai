# TODO: Ghostwriter AI Improvement Roadmap

## 🎉 Recent Updates (2025-08-14)

### Critical Fixes Completed ✅
- **Thread Safety**: Fixed race conditions in cache_manager.py, verified containers.py, secured events.py
- **Error Recovery**: Added checkpoint system, atomic file operations, automatic resume capability
- **Token Management**: Integrated tiktoken for accuracy, added budget tracking with warnings
- **Code Quality**: Fixed line lengths, added type hints, replaced print with logging

### Impact
These critical fixes have made the codebase significantly more robust, thread-safe, and production-ready. The application can now handle failures gracefully, resume from interruptions, and accurately track token usage.
